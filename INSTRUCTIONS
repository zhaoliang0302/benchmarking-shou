# CIBERSORT.R file (Newman, et al) is to be installed in a selected working directory in Hoffman. These instructions will install Hoffman and user will be able to run a batch job.
# Create R file.

$ vi "CIBERSORT.R"

# Paste [CIBERSORT.R]

# User must upload or paste desired input data sets into the same working directory in which CIBERSORT.R is located. User can do this through copy/paste (preferred) or client like Cyberduck.

$ vi "file1.txt" #should be signatures file ("swindellsigs.txt" for reference)
$ vi "file2.txt" #should be mixed expression file to be tested (Samplemix)

# In the same working directory, check available R versions on the cluster. Loading R is NOT necessary.
# In Hoffman, current default R as of 8 Feb. 2018 should be v3.2.3. This will be enough (and preferred) for CIBERSORT.

$ module av R

# Install/update required libraries onto the selected version of R, interactively. To do this, user should request an interactive node with minimal power and data requirements.

$ qrsh -l h_rt=1:00:00,h_data=2G
$ module load R
$ R

# Create two files, 1. wrapper-type script that feeds inputs into R and 2. batch command script that contains file selections to execute job.
# call_cibersort.R will take the batch command script and feed it into CIBERSORT.R

$ vi "call_cibersort.R"

# Paste in and save file "call_cibersort.R" found in this same repository.

# create the batch job submission file.

$ vi "submit_cibersort.cmd"

# Paste in and save file "submit_cibersort.cmd" found in this same repository.

# User can modify the signature file (input1.txt) and mixed sample file (input2.txt) through submission script only.
# "Call" and "Submit" files can be tweaked to change more options from default.

# Finally, user is able to run CIBERSORT with the folowwing command.

$ qsub "submit_cibersort.cmd"
